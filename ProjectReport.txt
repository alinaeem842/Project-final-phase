Project Description 
This is RSA Cryptograpy simulation, RSA is an asymmetric cryptography meaning it works on 2 keys which are public and private keys both keys are derived from the same 2 user input prime numbers the strength lies in the length/size of key since it is hard to factorize large numbers, we aimed to give the user complete input control.

Discrete Math Concepts Used 
we have used GCD,Modular Multiplicative Inverse,printing of relatively prime numbers and Euler's Function, firstly GCD is used to find the relatively prime numbers in the method of coprime in the code, secondly Modular Multiplicative Inverse is used for encryption and decryption in encrypt_block and decrypt_block method respectively and it is also used for deriving private key, coprime method is used to print the list relativly prime number where each number is greater than 1 and less than the euler's function this list is printed for the selection of 'e', lastly euler's function is used for the printing of relatively prime numbers and derving of private key

 Example 1: GCD 
Method of GCD. 
```Python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        c = a % b
        a = b
        b = c
    return a
```
 Example 2: List of Relatively Prime Numbers 
Method of coprime. 
```Python
def coprimes(a):
    l = []
    for x in range(2, a):
        if gcd(a, x) == 1 and modinv(x,phi) != None:
            l.append(x)
    for x in l:
        if x == modinv(x,phi):
            l.remove(x)
    return l
```
 Example 3: Modular Multiplicative Inverse 
Method of modinv. 
```Python
def modinv(a, m):
    for x in range(1, m):
        if (a * x) % m == 1:
            return x
    return None
```
 Example 4: Euler's Function 
Code of Euler's Function. 
```Python
phi=(p-1)*(q-1)
print("Euler's function [phi(n)]:" + str(phi) + "\n")
```

 Problems we Faced 
The problems we faced were that at times the code didn't print decrypted or encrypted value and second was faced at the start of project which was to return the encrypt or decrypt block as a string.

 Problem 1: not printing  encrpyted and decrypted data 
we resolved this issue by structuring the data in different method sice in python methods can be created in middle of code because of that at times some values of variable would change causing hindrance in either printing encrypted or decrypted data. 

Problem 2: how to return the encrypt or decrypt block as a string 
this problem was solved as the initial code was being created by joining the blocks of encrypted and decrypted data with an empty string.
